I'll be writing a bunch of card game variants and hope to eventually factor out an engine that's useful for quickly implenting new card games
Current Status

Klondike works
    needs front end
Hearts does not work
    ensure hearts can't be lead until broken
    no garbage on first trick
    needs server? ai for testing (just play first valid card)
    getInput needs to be player specific
