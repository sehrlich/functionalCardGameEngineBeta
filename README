I'll be writing a bunch of card game variants and hope to eventually factor out an engine that's useful for quickly implenting new card games
Current Status

Front end
    switch to using gui thread rather than text-based
        -- * gui spawns text based thread and acts as a pipe -- * move render text to being printed on gui, but still
        --     read moves from std input
        -- * draw cards
        -- * mouse interaction with cards
        -- * let cards request interaction with target
        -- * remove dependence on cli
        * use lenses to clear up nested record updates
        * disentagle depth/height from id
        * display images in depth order
        * display sensible text
    Medium/Long term wants for GUI
        sensible text boxes
        menus
        buttons
        draggable/clickable objects
        regions
        sensible object overlaps (works with clicking)
        draw images/bitmaps
        sound and music stuff --- see Kevin Mcleod's site (Incompetech) for cc-type music
        threepenny gui backend (maybe switch between gloss and threepenny?)
    Philosophy
        Gui cannot draw anything the server doesn't tell it about (it may choose not to draw redundant info)
Hearts
    display cards in trick according to position
    display scores, pass left/right/across messages
    make button for passing/allow selection deselection

    maybe:
    -- move to mvc
    -- rpc/servery thing,
    -- stop computing scores along the way and store tricks, then compute at round end
    -- ai can be better for testing (if can dodge trick, throw points. If can't win big)
    -- revamp info with lenses
    -- quickCheck isValidPlay
    -- make some sort of monady thing that ensures player input is always validated
Spades
Klondike
    redo with gui (and maybe client server nonsense)

Also separate out prototype client gui etc as playing cards is separated


logging and replay
stuff for tutorials/scenarios
    scripted events
    messages
menus
zones
default ways of doing selection in a zone -- i.e. select and unselect until click done


revamp world with markIIrender etc.
