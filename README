I'll be writing a bunch of card game variants and hope to eventually factor out an engine that's useful for quickly implenting new card games
Current Status: Hearts is playable, no scoring info

Front end
    Medium/Long term wants for GUI
        sensible text boxes
        menus
        buttons
        draggable/clickable objects
        regions
        sensible object overlaps (works with clicking)
        draw images/bitmaps
        sound and music stuff --- see Kevin Mcleod's site (Incompetech) for cc-type music
        threepenny gui backend (maybe switch between gloss and threepenny?)
Hearts
    graphics:
    BUG: after a card gets played it gets displayed at beginning of hand until trick is cleared
    -- display cards in trick according to position -- make this non-ugly
    display scores, pass left/right/across messages
    display opp's hands as card backs
        animate opps playing cards/sweeping cards off table
        better card rendering
    
    usability:
    make button for passing/allow selection deselection
        indicate whose turn it is

    architecture:

        -- pull zone class into separate module
        (possibly with basic gui constructor stuff,
        something that can consume a protocol and produce something sensible)

        pass in idSupply, player position in relevant place
        autogenerate ids for things without ids

    maybe:
    -- move to mvc
    -- stop computing scores along the way and store tricks, then compute at round end
    -- ai can be better for testing (if can dodge trick, throw points. If can't win big)
    -- quickCheck isValidPlay
    -- make some sort of monady thing that ensures player input is always validated


Spades
Klondike
    redo with gui (and maybe client server nonsense)

Also separate out prototype client gui etc as playing cards is separated

make everything cabal or stackage friendly
logging and replay
stuff for tutorials/scenarios
    scripted events
    messages
menus

disentangle heartsGui from generic Gui stuff ala PlayingCards
    genericGui should have
        zones
        buttons
        setting up the gloss thread, inbox, outbox
        -- registering stuff / generic things 
        generic rendering stuff
